Among the risk factors for psoriasis, evidence is accumulating that nutrition plays a major role, per se, in psoriasis pathogenesis. In particular, body weight, nutrition, and diet may exacerbate the clinical manifestations, or even trigger the disease. Understanding the epidemiological relationship between obesity and psoriasis is also important for delineating the risk profile for the obesity-related comorbidities commonly found among psoriatic patients. Moreover, obesity can affect both drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Additionally, the overall beneficial effects on the obesity-associated comorbidities, clinical recommendations to reduce weight and to adopt a healthy lifestyle could improve the psoriasis severity, particularly in those patients with moderate to severe disease, thus exerting additional therapeutic effects in the conventional treatment in obese patients with psoriasis. Education regarding modifiable environmental factors is essential in the treatment of this disease and represents one of the primary interventions that can affect the prognosis of patients with psoriasis. The goal is to make psoriatic patients and health care providers aware of beneficial dietary interventions. The aim of this review is to assess the relevance of the environmental factors as modifiable risk factors in psoriasis pathogenesis, with particular regard to the involvement of obesity and nutrition in the management of psoriasis, providing also specific nutrition recommendations",

Design Face-to-face semistructured interviews were conducted until data saturation, and thematic analysis based on principles of grounded theory. Setting 21 haemodialysis centres across Australia. Participants 42 haemodialysis clinicians (nephrologists and nephrology trainees (15), nurses (12) and dietitians (15)) were purposively sampled to obtain a range of demographic characteristics and clinical experiences. Results Six themes were identified: responding to changing clinical status (individualising strategies to patient needs, prioritising acute events, adapting guidelines), integrating patient circumstances (assimilating life priorities, access and affordability), delineating specialty roles in collaborative structures (shared and cohesive care, pivotal role of dietary expertise, facilitating access to nutritional care, perpetuating conflicting advice and patient confusion, devaluing nutritional specialty), empowerment for behaviour change (enabling comprehension of complexities, building autonomy and ownership, developing self-efficacy through engagement, tailoring self-management strategies), initiating and sustaining motivation (encountering motivational hurdles, empathy for confronting life changes, fostering non-judgemental relationships, emphasising symptomatic and tangible benefits, harnessing support networks), and organisational and staffing barriers (staffing shortfalls, readdressing system inefficiencies). Conclusions Organisational support with collaborative multidisciplinary teams and individualised patient care were seen as necessary for developing positive patient-clinician relationships, delivering consistent nutrition advice, and building and sustaining patient motivation to enable change in dietary behaviour. Improving service delivery and developing and delivering targeted, multifaceted self-management interventions may enhance current nutritional management of patients on haemodialysis",

Fasting lipid profiles were obtained at diagnosis. Standardized dietary recommendations were provided. After 1 year, lipid profiles were repeated and interpreted according to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction. Main outcomes were meeting criteria for clinically actionable dyslipidemia at baseline, and either achieving lipid goal at follow-up or meeting criteria for ongoing intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nThere were 585 participants, with a mean age of 12.8 years. The prevalence of children warranting intervention for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at baseline was 14%. After 1 year of recommended dietary changes, 51% achieved goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 27% qualified for enhanced dietary and lifestyle modifications, and 22% met criteria for pharmacologic intervention. Elevated triglycerides were more prevalent, with 51% meeting criteria for intervention. At 1 year, 25% achieved goal triglycerides with diet and lifestyle changes, 38% met criteria for advanced dietary modifications, and 37% qualified for antihyperlipidemic medications.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nMore than one-half of children with NAFLD met intervention thresholds for dyslipidemia.

In acute pancreatitis, a prebiotic enriched diet is associated with low rates of pancreatic necrosis infection, hospital stay, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiorgan failure. This protective effect seems to be connected with the ability of fibre to stabilise the disturbed intestinal barrier homeostasis and to reduce the infection rate. On the other hand, in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a high content fibre diet is associated with an increased wet fecal weight and fecal fat excretion because of the fibre inhibition of pancreatic enzymes. The mechanism by which dietary fibre reduces the pancreatic enzyme activity is still not clear. It seems likely that pancreatic enzymes are absorbed on the fibre surface or entrapped in pectin, a gel-like substance, and are likely inactivated by anti-nutrient compounds present in some foods. The aim of the present review is to highlight the current knowledge on the role of fibre in the nutritional management of patients with pancreatic disorders",

Obesity afflicts 17% of US children and adolescents. Severe obesity (\u00b3120% of the 95th percentile of BMI-for-age, or a BMI of \u00b335 kg/m2) is the fastest growing subgroup and now approaches 6% of all US youth. Health consequences (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease) are related in a dose-dependent manner to severity of obesity. Since therapeutic interventions are less effective in severe obesity, prevention is a high priority.\nTreatment plans involving combinations of behavioral therapy, nutrition and exercise achieve limited success. Only one drug, orlistat, is FDA-approved for long-term obesity management in adolescents 12 years and older. As part of comprehensive medication management, clinicians should consider the propensity for a given drug to aggravate weight gain and to consider alternatives that minimize weight impact. Medication management must take into account developmental changes as well as pathophysiology of obesity and comorbidities.\nDespite expanding insight into obesity pathophysiology, there are gaps in its translation to therapeutic application. The historical construct of obesity as simply a fat storage disorder is fundamentally inaccurate.\nThe approach to adjusting doses based solely on body size and extrapolating from therapeutic knowledge of adult obesity may be based on assumptions that are not fully substantiated.

    "conclusion": "Nutrition and diet play a significant, often modifiable, role in various health conditions. For instance, in psoriasis, a chronic skin disease, diet and body weight are major risk factors, capable of triggering or worsening symptoms. Reducing weight and adopting a healthy lifestyle can notably improve disease severity, especially for obese patients, even enhancing the effects of conventional treatments. Education on these dietary interventions is crucial for better patient outcomes.\n\nDietary factors also strongly influence inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis, potentially explaining rising incidence. Reviews highlight the need to understand diet's role in disease etiology, as well as its use in therapy and assessing nutritional status. Similarly, the impact of fiber in pancreatic diseases is complex; it may help reduce infection in acute pancreatitis but can hinder enzyme activity in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nPediatric obesity, now recognized as a chronic disease, presents significant challenges. It's a growing subgroup, with severe consequences like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Beyond general lifestyle interventions, managing medications requires considering a drug's potential to cause weight gain and adjusting doses, as adult-based extrapolations may not apply. Children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease frequently exhibit clinically significant dyslipidemia, underscoring the necessity of lipid screening and management through dietary changes.\n\nIn the realm of serious interventions, intestinal transplantation has shown promising results. Most patients, even those receiving composite grafts, can be liberated from total parenteral nutrition, supporting good growth and nutrition, particularly in children. While challenging to manage, these outcomes justify further trials, with intestine-only transplants often showing faster recovery.\n\nProviding effective nutritional care faces its own hurdles. Healthcare providers in Australia, discussing hemodialysis patient management, emphasized the need for individualized, collaborative, multidisciplinary care. Key themes included adapting to changing clinical needs, integrating patient life circumstances, navigating specialty roles to avoid conflicting advice, empowering patients for behavior change, and fostering motivation. Organizational and staffing limitations were also significant barriers. Finally, in pediatric Crohn's disease, families, while accepting exclusive enteral nutrition, strongly prefer and advocate for the development of alternative solid food-based dietary treatments, highlighting a desire for less restrictive options."

To maintain a scalable yet effective communication protocol, we introduce a Multiagent Bidirectionally-Coordinated Network (BiCNet [\\'bIknet]) with a vectorised extension of actor-critic formulation. We show that BiCNet can handle different types of combats with arbitrary numbers of AI agents for both sides. Our analysis demonstrates that without any supervisions such as human demonstrations or labelled data, BiCNet could learn various types of advanced coordination strategies that have been commonly used by experienced game players. In our experiments, we evaluate our approach against multiple baselines under different scenarios; it shows state-of-the-art performance, and possesses potential values for large-scale real-world applications.Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures.

        "subContent": "AI systems that learn through reward feedback about the actions they take are increasingly deployed in domains that have significant impact on our daily life. However, in many cases the online rewards should not be the only guiding criteria, as there are additional constraints and/or priorities imposed by regulations, values, preferences, or ethical principles. We detail a novel online agent that learns a set of behavioral constraints by observation and uses these learned constraints as a guide when making decisions in an online setting while still being reactive to reward feedback. To define this agent, we propose to adopt a novel extension to the classical contextual multi-armed bandit setting and we provide a new algorithm called Behavior Constrained Thompson Sampling (BCTS) that allows for online learning while obeying exogenous constraints. Our agent learns a constrained policy that implements the observed behavioral constraints demonstrated by a teacher agent, and then uses this constrained policy to guide the reward-based online exploration and exploitation. We characterize the upper bound on the expected regret of the contextual bandit algorithm that underlies our agent and provide a case study with real world data in two application domains. Our experiments show that the designed agent is able to act within the set of behavior constraints without significantly degrading its overall reward performance.Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure",

These techniques have seldom been integrated and evaluated as complete systems. In this paper, we report on the development of an assistant agent architecture that integrates plan recognition, current and future user information needs, workload estimation and adaptive information presentation to aid an emergency response manager in making high quality decisions under time stress, while avoiding cognitive overload. We describe the main components of a full implementation of this architecture as well as a simulation developed to evaluate the system. Our evaluation consists of simulating various possible executions of the emergency response plans used in the real world and measuring the expected time taken by an unaided human user, as well as one that receives information assistance from our system. In the experimental condition of agent assistance, we also examine the effects of different error rates in the agent's estimation of user's stat or information needs",

        "subContent": "No real-world reward function is perfect. Sensory errors and software bugs may result in RL agents observing higher (or lower) rewards than they should. For example, a reinforcement learning agent may prefer states where a sensory error gives it the maximum reward, but where the true reward is actually small. We formalise this problem as a generalised Markov Decision Problem called Corrupt Reward MDP. Traditional RL methods fare poorly in CRMDPs, even under strong simplifying assumptions and when trying to compensate for the possibly corrupt rewards. Two ways around the problem are investigated. First, by giving the agent richer data, such as in inverse reinforcement learning and semi-supervised reinforcement learning, reward corruption stemming from systematic sensory errors may sometimes be completely managed. Second, by using randomisation to blunt the agent's optimisation, reward corruption can be partially managed under some assumptions.Comment: A shorter version of this report was accepted to IJCAI 2017 AI and Autonomy trac",

Our intention is to put intelligent agents into a simulated natural context and verify if the principles developed in the real world could also be used in understanding an artificially-created intelligent population. To achieve this, we simulate a large-scale predator-prey world, where the laws of the world are designed by only the findings or logical equivalence that have been discovered in nature. We endow the agents with the intelligence based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In order to scale the population size up to millions agents, a large-scale DRL training platform with redesigned experience buffer is proposed. Our results show that the population dynamics of AI agents, driven only by each agent's individual self-interest, reveals an ordered pattern that is similar to the Lotka-Volterra model studied in population biology. We further discover the emergent behaviors of collective adaptations in studying how the agents' grouping behaviors will change with the environmental resources. Both of the two findings could be explained by the self-organization theory in nature.Comment: Full version of the paper presented at AAMAS 2018 (International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems",

        "subContent": "Hybrid agent architectures comprise the radical change of paradigms in AI over the past decades by reconciling the different styles of reactive, deliberative, even social systems. They have been successfully applied to a range of complex real-world domains. Due to their originally informal background, a verification of design goals in derived implementations, theoretical foundations, and a detailed comparison with other agent models have not yet been obvious. The present work proposes a formal methodology to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical aspects especially of hybrid designs, such as the layered INTERRAP. The employed, connected stages of specification, i.e., architecture, computational model, theory, proof calculus, and implementation, also provide a yet unique framework for comparing heterogeneous agent models including unified and logic-based ones. Based on recent work on INTERRAP, we demonstrate that this methodology allows to compare state-of-the-art designs from robotics, AI, computer science, and cognitive science with respect to a spectrum of inherent properties along the two dimensions of abstraction and declarativity. This supports our claim that INTERRAP is a coherent and advanced account of layered agency including goal-oriented abstraction planning in on-line interaction with reactive skills and social reasoning. We also derive particular research issues to guide the future development of INTERRAP",

    "conclusion": "This collection of papers highlights diverse challenges and advancements in artificial intelligence, primarily focusing on designing, deploying, and improving AI agents for real-world applications. A recurring theme is the necessity for agents to manage resources, learn effectively, and adapt to complex, dynamic, and often imperfect environments.\n\nSeveral studies address the fundamental computational hurdles agents face. One paper explores the inherent complexity of metareasoning, demonstrating that tasks like allocating deliberation time or information-gathering resources are computationally very difficult. Similarly, research into agent architectures emphasizes effective scheduling to manage time resources. The AI Bus architecture is presented as a flexible, distributed framework for building large-scale, robust AI systems that can integrate various components. This is further elaborated by a cognitive architecture designed to assist human decision-makers in high-stress situations, such as emergency response, by integrating elements like plan recognition and workload estimation. A broader cognitive model, LIDA, is also discussed as an integrated framework for creating human-like agents capable of multiple learning mechanisms and effective action in complex settings, driven by artificial feelings. A formal method for comparing different agent models is also proposed, bridging theoretical and practical design aspects.\n\nOn the learning and adaptation front, one research introduces a multi-agent system capable of learning complex, human-level coordination strategies in combat games without direct supervision. Another critical area explored is dealing with imperfect information, specifically corrupted reward signals in reinforcement learning, with proposed solutions involving richer data or controlled randomization. A novel online AI agent is also presented, which learns and incorporates behavioral constraints observed from a teacher, enabling it to adhere to ethical principles or regulations while still pursuing its reward objectives. Investigating AI at scale, an empirical study of millions of reinforcement learning agents in a simulated ecosystem reveals emergent, ordered population dynamics similar to those found in nature. Finally, a new benchmark, the Toy Box Problem, is proposed to rigorously evaluate the practical intelligence and learning capabilities of agents, pushing towards achieving Strong AI."
